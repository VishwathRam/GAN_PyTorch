# GAN PyTorch Synthetic Medical Image Generator
Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are algorithmic architectures that use two neural networks, pitting one against the other (thus the “adversarial”) in order to generate new, synthetic instances of data that can pass for real data. They are used widely in image generation, video generation and voice generation.

This Model is written and trained in PyTorch on a google colab notebook. The model was trained on the ISAC 2016 Skin Cancer dataset.
